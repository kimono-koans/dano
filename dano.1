.SH DESCRIPTION
dano 0.3.0
dano is a wrapper for ffmpeg that checksums the internal file streams of certain media files, and
stores them in a format which can be used to verify such checksums later.  This is handy, because,
should you choose to change metadata tags, or change file names, the media checksums *should* remain
the same.
.SS "USAGE:"
.IP
dano [OPTIONS] [\-\-] [INPUT_FILES]...
.SS "ARGS:"
.TP
<INPUT_FILES>...
input files to be hashed or checked.  INPUT_FILES can also be read from
stdin for NULL or NEWLINE delimited inputs.
.SS "OPTIONS:"
.HP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\-file=\fR<OUTPUT_FILE>...
.IP
output file which will hold the hashes. If not specified, 'dano_hashes.txt' in the PWD
will be used.
.HP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-hash\-file=\fR<HASH_FILE>...
.TP
file from which to read the hashes.
If not specified, the output file will be used (or
.IP
if not specified 'dano_hashes.txt' in the PWD).
.HP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-write\fR
.IP
write the input files' hashes.
.HP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-test\fR
.IP
compare the hashes in a hash file to the files currently on disk.
.HP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-compare\fR
.IP
compare the input files to the hashes in a hash file (or in a xattr).
.HP
\fB\-j\fR, \fB\-\-threads=\fR<NUM_THREADS>...
.TP
requested number of threads to use for file processing.
Default is twice the number of
.IP
logical cores.
.HP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-print\fR
.IP
pretty print the file hashes.
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-silent\fR
.IP
quiet many informational messages (like "OK").
.HP
\fB\-\-write\-new\fR
.IP
if new files are present in COMPARE mode, append such file info.
.HP
\fB\-\-overwrite\fR
.IP
if one file's hash matches another's, but they have different file name's, overwrite the
old file's info with the most current.
.HP
\fB\-\-disable\-filter\fR
.TP
by default, dano filters file extensions not recognized by ffmpeg.
Here, you may
.IP
disable such filtering.
.HP
\fB\-\-canonical\-paths\fR
.IP
use canonical paths (instead of potentially relative paths).
.HP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-xattr\fR
.IP
try to write (dano will always try to read) hash to/from file's extended attributes.
Can also be enabled by setting environment variable DANO_XATTR_WRITES to any value.
.HP
\fB\-\-hash\-algo=\fR<HASH_ALGO>...
.TP
specify the algorithm to use for hashing.
Default is 'murmur3'. [possible values:
.IP
murmur3, md5, crc32, adler32, sha1, sha160, sha256, sha384, sha512]
.HP
\fB\-\-decode\fR
.TP
decode stream before hashing.
Much slower, but potentially useful for lossless formats.
.HP
\fB\-\-rewrite\fR
.TP
rewrite all recorded hashes to the latest and greatest format version.
dano will ignore
.IP
input files without recorded hashes.
.HP
\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR
.IP
print the information to stdout that would be written to disk.
.HP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.IP
Print help information
.HP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
.IP
Print version information
