.SH DESCRIPTION
dano 0.9.1
dano is a wrapper for ffmpeg that checksums the internal bitstreams of held within certain media
files/containers, and stores them in a format which can be used to verify such checksums later.
This is handy, because, should you choose to change metadata tags, or change file names, the media
checksums should remain the same.
.SS "USAGE:"
.IP
dano [OPTIONS] [\-\-] [INPUT_FILES]...
.SS "ARGS:"
.TP
<INPUT_FILES>...
select the input files to be hashed or verified, etc.  INPUT_FILES can
also be read from stdin for NULL or NEWLINE delimited inputs.  By
default, files which don't appear to be valid extensions for ffmpeg are
filtered with a WARN message, unless the SILENT flag is enabled.  Hidden
files (so\-called dot files), files with no name, or no extension are
silently ignored.  The default behavior can be disabled with the
DISABLE_FILTER flag.
.SS "OPTIONS:"
.HP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\-file=\fR<OUTPUT_FILE>...
.IP
select the output file to record the file information. If not specified,
\&'dano_hashes.txt' in the current working directory will be used.
.HP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-hash\-file=\fR<HASH_FILE>...
.TP
select the file from which to read recorded file information.
If not specified, the
.IP
output file will be used (or if not specified, 'dano_hashes.txt' in the current working
directory will be used).
.HP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-write\fR
.TP
write the new input files' hash information.
If no other flags are specified, dano will
.IP
ignore files which already have file hashes.
.HP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-test\fR
.TP
verify the recorded file information.
Prints the pass/fail status, and exits with a
.IP
non\-zero code, if failed, and can, potentially, performs write operations when
specified, by the WRITE_NEW and OVERWRITE_OLD flags.
.HP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-print\fR
.IP
pretty print all recorded file information (discovered within both the hash file and any
xattrs).
.HP
\fB\-\-dump\fR
.IP
dump the recorded file information (in hash file and xattrs) to the output file (don't
test/compare).
.HP
\fB\-\-duplicates\fR
.IP
show any hash value duplicates discovered when reading back recorded file information
(in hash file and xattrs).
.HP
\fB\-\-clean\fR
.IP
remove any hash files, given as input files, and remove any extended attributes, given
as input files.
.HP
\fB\-\-import\-flac\fR
.IP
import flac checksums and write such information as dano recorded file information.
.HP
\fB\-j\fR, \fB\-\-threads=\fR<NUM_THREADS>...
.TP
requested number of threads to use for file processing.
Default is the number of
.IP
logical cores.
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-silent\fR
.IP
quiet many informational messages (such as "OK").
.HP
\fB\-\-write\-new\fR
.IP
in TEST mode, when not writing to an extended attribute, if new files are present, write
new file info to the hash file.
.HP
\fB\-\-overwrite\fR
.IP
in TEST mode, when not writing to an extended attribute, if a file's hash matches a
recorded hash, but that file now has a different file name, overwrite file info with the
most current to the hash file.
.HP
\fB\-\-disable\-filter\fR
.IP
disable the default filtering of file extensions which ffmpeg lists as "common"
extensions for supported file formats.
.HP
\fB\-\-canonical\-paths\fR
.IP
use canonical paths (paths from the root directory) instead of potentially relative
paths.
.HP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-xattr\fR
.IP
try to write (dano will always try to read) hash to any input file's extended
attributes.  Can also be enabled by setting environment variable DANO_XATTR_WRITES to
any value (such as: export DANO_XATTR_WRITES=enabled).  When XATTR is enabled, if a
write is requested, dano will always overwrite extended attributes previously written.
.HP
\fB\-\-hash\-algo=\fR<HASH_ALGO>...
.TP
specify the algorithm to use for hashing.
Default is 'murmur3'. [possible values:
.IP
murmur3, md5, crc32, adler32, sha1, sha160, sha256, sha384, sha512]
.HP
\fB\-\-decode\fR
.TP
decode internal bitstream before hashing.
This option makes testing and writes much
.IP
slower, but this option is potentially useful for lossless formats.
.HP
\fB\-\-rewrite\fR
.TP
rewrite all recorded hashes to the latest and greatest format version.
When specified,
.IP
dano will silently ignore any input files without recorded hashes.
.HP
\fB\-\-only=\fR<ONLY>
.TP
hash the an input file container's first audio or video stream only, if available.
dano
.IP
will fall back to default behavior, if no stream is available. [possible values: audio,
video]
.HP
\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR
.IP
print the information to stdout that would be written to disk.
.HP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.IP
Print help information
.HP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
.IP
Print version information
