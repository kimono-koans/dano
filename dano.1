.SH DESCRIPTION
dano 0.3.4
dano is a wrapper for ffmpeg that checksums the internal file streams of certain media files, and
stores them in a format which can be used to verify such checksums later.  This is handy, because,
should you choose to change metadata tags, or change file names, the media checksums should remain
the same.
.SS "USAGE:"
.IP
dano [OPTIONS] [\-\-] [INPUT_FILES]...
.SS "ARGS:"
.TP
<INPUT_FILES>...
input files to be hashed or checked.  INPUT_FILES can also be read from
stdin for NULL or NEWLINE delimited inputs.
.SS "OPTIONS:"
.HP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\-file=\fR<OUTPUT_FILE>...
.IP
output file which will contain the hashes. If not specified, 'dano_hashes.txt' in the
current working directory will be used.
.HP
\fB\-k\fR, \fB\-\-hash\-file=\fR<HASH_FILE>...
.TP
file from which to read hashes.
If not specified, the output file will be used (or if
.IP
not specified 'dano_hashes.txt' in the current working directory).
.HP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-write\fR
.IP
write the new input files' hashes (and ignore files that already have file hashes).
.HP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-test\fR
.IP
compare the hashes in a hash file to the files currently on disk.
.HP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-compare\fR
.IP
compare the input files to the hashes in a hash file (and/or contained within a file's
xattrs).
.HP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-print\fR
.IP
pretty print the file hashes.
.HP
\fB\-\-dump\fR
.IP
dump the recorded file information (hashes and xattrs) to the output file (don't
test/compare).
.HP
\fB\-j\fR, \fB\-\-threads=\fR<NUM_THREADS>...
.TP
requested number of threads to use for file processing.
Default is twice the number of
.IP
logical cores.
.HP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-silent\fR
.IP
quiet many informational messages (like "OK").
.HP
\fB\-\-write\-new\fR
.IP
if new files are present in COMPARE mode, append such file info.
.HP
\fB\-\-overwrite\fR
.IP
if one file's hash matches another's, but they have different file name's, overwrite the
old file's info with the most current.
.HP
\fB\-\-disable\-filter\fR
.TP
by default, file extensions not recognized by ffmpeg are filtered.
Here, you may
.IP
disable such filtering.
.HP
\fB\-\-canonical\-paths\fR
.IP
use canonical paths (instead of potentially relative paths).
.HP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-xattr\fR
.IP
try to write (dano will always try to read) hash to/from file's extended attributes.
Can also be enabled by setting environment variable DANO_XATTR_WRITES to any value.
.HP
\fB\-\-hash\-algo=\fR<HASH_ALGO>...
.TP
specify the algorithm to use for hashing.
Default is 'murmur3'. [possible values:
.IP
murmur3, md5, crc32, adler32, sha1, sha160, sha256, sha384, sha512]
.HP
\fB\-\-decode\fR
.TP
decode stream before hashing.
Much slower, but potentially useful for lossless formats.
.HP
\fB\-\-rewrite\fR
.TP
rewrite all recorded hashes to the latest and greatest format version.
dano will ignore
.IP
input files without recorded hashes.
.HP
\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR
.IP
print the information to stdout that would be written to disk.
.HP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
.IP
Print help information
.HP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
.IP
Print version information
